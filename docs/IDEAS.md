# Future Ideas
- [ ] Drone follows rover
- [ ] Add multiple vehicle types support (rover, drone, plane) at the same time
- [ ] Separate launch file more and have a single launch file for starting one vehicle without environment, this may make more sense for the long run especially multi-vehicle types
- [ ] Treat airsim config generation similarly and add single vehicle to json at a time
